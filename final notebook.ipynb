    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The people of Tanzania are facing a water crisis and Wells of Life is trying to help. Their goal is to repair water wells in Tanzania so that so that the citizens have water that is safe for drinking and hygiene needs. The goal of this notebook is to produce a strong classification model that can accurately classify the functionality of wells in Tanzania. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Wells of Life is a foundation that is trying to help alleviate the water/health crisis in Tanzania, but they currently do not have the means to efficiently identify which wells need repair. They want to repair not only the non functional wells, but also the wells that are somewhat functional due to the health and safety risks associated with extracting water from faulty wells. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Stakeholder__: Wells Of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Stakeholders' pain points__: Citizens in Tanzania are dehydrated and are forced to drink water that is not safe. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Importance of Predictions__ Predicting the operating condition of a waterpoint is important because of the water crisis in Tanzania. Many people in Tanzania are having to resort to contaminated rivers for drinking water which can cause disease and death. Predicting water pumps that are functional vs non-functional can help guide our Stakeholder where to direct their attention for repairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Deliverable__: The Classification Model is our deliverable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Type of Model__: A complex model that can efficiently help Wells for Life make repairs on wells that actually need repairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __False Positive__: The model classifying a waterwell as functional when it is actuallly non functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __False Negative__: The model classifying a waterwell as non functional while it is functional or partly functional. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Which is Worse__: False positives are worse, classifying a non working well as functional means tha the residents of that area will have to take chances with water that is not safe or travel miles further to another well, while a false negative will only result in the inspection of a functional well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Metric Significance__: \n",
    "    - __Precision__\n",
    "    - Accuracy\n",
    "    - f1 score\n",
    "    - recall\n",
    " - The higher our precsion score, the lower our chance of classifying a non functioning well as functional.\n",

    "- Out of 5438 wells that were classified as functional only 1180 of them were actually non functional.\n",
    "- A precision score of 78 percent means that we have a pretty low false positive rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We reccommend that you use this model in conjuction with your own resources in order to identify faulty wells with optimal precision.\n",
    "- Our model will still classify some non functional wells as functional 29% of the time so further investigation will be needed at times. \n",
    "\n",

    "#### Future work\n",
    "- Further engineer more features to give our model better data to make predictions off of.\n",
    "- Further tune hyperparameters to optomize our models performance on unseen data.\n",
    "- With more time we would like to input weather climate data into our model."
